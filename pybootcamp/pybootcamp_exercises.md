# Simple programming exercises in Python 

## Exercise 1

Create a program that asks the user to enter her/his name and her/his age. It has to print out a message that tells the year she/he will turn 100 years old.

For example:
```
$ python3 ex1.py
What is your name: Pietro
How old are you: 25
Pietro will be 100 years old in the year 2089
$ _  
```



```python

```

## Exercise 2
Write a **function** called `char_frequency` that gets a string as input parameter and returns a dictionary where each element stores the number of characters (character frequency) of the string received.

For example:

```
def char_frequency(in_str):
    #
    # here is where your code is supposed to go
    #
    return dict
    
print(char_frequency('google.com'))
```

Executing the code you should get: 
```
{'g': 2, 'o': 3, 'l': 1, 'e': 1, '.': 1, 'c': 1, 'm': 1}
``` 





```python

```

## Exercise 3
Using the information relative to file managment that you can find here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files write a  program that reads a text file line by line and stores it into a list.


```python

```
